I wanted to build an app with a timer that was easy to see from anywhere and one that could easily be used in-between sets. \n<br><br>\nI worked with my friends at Shag City to develop custom sounds which add utility and delight to the app, even when you're dying from the last set.</span>\n  </div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"mb-24\">\n  <div class=\"col-8\">\n    <img src=\"/img/products/circuit/01.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-zoomable> \n  </div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"mb-24\">\n  <div class=\"col-8\">\n    <img src=\"/img/products/circuit/02.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-zoomable> \n    <p class=\"caption\">This was my first time building an app clip which helps me easily onboard new users at the gym who are curious and want to try out the app. Give it a shot yourself!</p>\n  </div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"mb-24\">\n  <div class=\"col-8\">\n    <img src=\"/img/products/circuit/03.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-zoomable> \n    <p class=\"caption\">Simple settings let users easily jump into their favorite workouts.</p>\n  </div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"mb-24\">\n  <div class=\"col-8\">\n    <img src=\"/img/products/circuit/04.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-zoomable> \n    <p class=\"caption\">The Circuit logo is a dynamic element that doubles as a visual representation of your work and rest timers.</p>\n  </div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"mb-24\">\n  <div class=\"col-8\">\n    <img src=\"/img/products/circuit/05.jpg\" data-zoomable> \n    <p class=\"caption\">A simple streak calendar helps you keep track of your consistency without any bells or whistles.</p>\n  </div>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <div class=\"col-8\">\n    <img src=\"/img/products/circuit/06.jpg\" data-zoomable> \n    <p class=\"caption\">One of the launch assets designed to highlight the amazing sounds Shag City recorded for the app.</p>\n  </div>\n</section>",
