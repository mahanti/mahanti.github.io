    "    <span class=\"subtitle\">I'm a Principal Product Designer at Block currently designing <a href=\"https://proto.xyz/\" target=\"_blank\">Proto</a> and special projects across the company.<br><br>I also have a small studio where I build iOS apps that are rooted in simple, elegant interactions. I focus on building purpose-built tools that feel natural, simple, and delightful to use.<br><br>My work is grounded in clarity and high craft, pairing rigor in detail with a willingness to explore unbounded possibilities. I believe in design as a process of uncovering the essential: iterating through exploration, testing through prototypes, and shaping experiences that feel obvious once they exist.<br><br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/arjunmahanti\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><br><br><a href=\"https://instagram.com/mahanti\">Instagram</a><br><br><a href=\"mailto:arjun.mahanti@gmail.com\">Email</a></span>",
