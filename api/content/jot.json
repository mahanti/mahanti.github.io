It was designed to solve the problem of having a quick idea or note and not being able to easily toss it into a notepad and move on. In an effort to reduce taps to start new notes, Jot always starts on a fresh page and simple swipe gestures let you archive and view notes.\n            <br><br>\n            During the pandemic in 2020, I took the time to learn SwiftUI and rebuild the app from the ground up which included folding in another project of mine — Napkin, which was Jot for drawing.</span>\n    </div>\n</section>\n<section>\n    <img src=\"/img/products/jot/01.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</section>\n<section>\n    <img src=\"/img/products/jot/02.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <p class=\"caption\">Napkin was a fun addition to Jot which enabled me to quickly sketch out concepts or UI in the middle of the night.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n    <img src=\"/img/products/jot/03.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <p class=\"caption\">The new user experience meant to quickly educate users on the interaction paradigm.</p>\n</section>\t\n<section>\n    <img src=\"/img/products/jot/04.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    <p class=\"caption\">Icons and themed variations for different tools.</p>\n</section>",
