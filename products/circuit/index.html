    <span class="subtitle">I often run through the same timers in the gym, whether for HIIT cycles or timing planks and stretches. I wanted to build an app with a timer that was easy to see from anywhere and could easily be used between sets.
      <br><br>
      I worked with my friends at Shag City to develop custom sounds that add utility and delight to the app, even when you're exhausted from the last set.</span>
