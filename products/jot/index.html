                Jot was the first iOS app I ever built, all the way back in 2013. It was designed to solve the problem of having a quick idea or note and not being able to easily capture it and move on. To reduce taps for starting new notes, Jot always starts on a fresh page and simple swipe gestures let you archive and view notes.
                <br><br>
                In 2020, I learned SwiftUI and rebuilt the app from the ground up, which included folding in another project of mine, Napkin, which was Jot for drawing.</span>
