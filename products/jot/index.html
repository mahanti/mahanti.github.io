    <span class="subtitle">The fastest app for notes and sketches. <br><br> Jot was the first iOS app I ever built, all the way back in 2013. It was designed to solve the problem of having a quick idea or note and not being able to easily capture it and move on. To reduce taps for starting new notes, Jot always starts on a fresh page and simple swipe gestures let you archive and view notes.<br><br>In 2020, I learned SwiftUI and rebuilt the app from the ground up, which included folding in another project of mine, Napkin, which was Jot for drawing. <br><br></span>
