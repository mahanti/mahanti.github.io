            <span class="title">Approach Golf Co.</span>
              <span class="subtitle">I started golfing in high school and was immediately hooked. After a few years off the course, I brushed off my old clubs and got back into it. While clubs, tools, and styles had all evolved since high school, the apps designed for golf were ugly and clunky, to say the least.
                <br><br>
                Built fully in SwiftUI, this app was mostly designed and built in code, opening the door to intuitive and fluid interactions that take advantage of iOS.</span>
