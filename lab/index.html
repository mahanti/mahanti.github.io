  <h1>Loader</h1>
  <p>We needed a new loader for Sidecar so I whipped up this, and a few others, using CSS animations. I had originally planned
  on a cascading animation but made a mistake with :nth-selector and ended up with what is shown above. Everyone ended up liking it
  more than the original so we went ahead with it. Happy mistakes!</p>

<h1>Invisilink</h1>
<p>I wanted to make links that were easier to click (larger click areas) so I used some margin trickery to let visitors click your links without having to be directly on top of the element. Science!</p>
