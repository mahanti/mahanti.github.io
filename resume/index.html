<h4>Objective</h4>
<p>A motto that I try to live by each day is, "Gradatim Ferociter" which loosely translates to, "Step by step, ferociously." I hope to find an opportunity that not only
supports that but pushes the bounds. I aim to work on a product that believes in understanding a persons problems before their own and with a team that will
do anything to solve that problem.</p>

<h4>Skills</h4>
<p><b>Tools:</b> Sketch, Adobe Creative Suite, Origami, Form</p>
<p><b>Web:</b> HTML5, CSS3, Javascript</p>

<h4>Education</h4>
<p>University of Michigan - <em>Ann Arbor, MI</em></p>

<h4>Professional Experience</h4>
<h5>Michigan Daily - Managing Design Editor</h5>
<p>As the MDE of the Michigan Daily, the student-run newspaper at The University of Michigan, I was responsible for the design and art direction of the newspaper. I led
a team of six designers who helped with layouts, illustrations, and working with other teams. The hours were rough (6PM - 3AM Sun-Thu) but working on a newspaper taught me how to react to changing information, prepare backups for things that go wrong, and 
how to effectively work with a number of groups under a tight timeline.</p>

<h5>Crowdflower - Design Intern</h5>
<p>Crowdflower, a data-driven crowdsourcing platform, brought me on as a design intern to help create a consistent visual language across their products through print ads,
a new marketing website, and digital ads.</p>
<p>Working with one of the many talented engineers at Crowdflower, I learned best practices for clean, reusable front-end code as well as creating simple data visualizations
using D3.js</p>

<h5>Sidecar - Design Intern</h5>
<p>Near the end of my internship at Crowdflower I heard about Sidecar and was intrigued by the concept â€“ and had a mutual connection through the University of Michigan. One
night after work, I sat down and redesigned what I believed Sidecar's website should look like and communicate. I sent it over and a week later had an internship offer.</p>
<p>As the first designer on a small team, my role oscillated between product design, graphic design, and product management. In my few months as an intern, I redesigned
the rider and driver apps for both iOS and Android as well as created a design language that was used on our website, print and launch materials.</p>

<h5>Sidecar - Product Designer</h5>
<p>I must have done something right during my internship because I got a full-time offer to officially join the team as the first product designer.</p>
<p>In my three years at the company I've played a critical role in three rebrands, three product revamps, and have helped create launch deliverables for 
15 cities nationwide.</p>
