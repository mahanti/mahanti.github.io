<p>Sidecar occasionally holds brown bag lunches where employees can give short talks about anything that they're passionate about. For this brown bag, one of our awesome iOS engineers, Lee Fastenau, wanted to talk about his history with making games for the Atari.</p>
<p>On a flight home from Michigan, I made this poster to put up around the office. In retrospect, and after hearing the talk, I wish I had tried to make a poster that could be drawn on an Atari (you can ask Lee about those limitations) but I was pretty happy with the outcome.</p>
