<p>This is an email header created for a Sidecar promotion we ran during ComicCon in San Diego, CA. While I was pleased with the character of the final piece it ultimately did not perform well in the field. This was due to
my lack of understanding of Facebook's guidelines for marketing images. Apparently if an image contains more than X% text it's flagged and not distributed as broadly. It's always a bummer when that something like that happens
but you live and your learn.</p>
<p>Below are a few different typefaces that I looked at when figuring out what direction to take this piece. A lot of them were chosen because they felt
like faces that could live in the comic universe.</p>
