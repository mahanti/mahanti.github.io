<p>In March of 2014, we ran an awesome campaign to highlight our new marketplace feature in Sidecar. Since Rider's could finally choose a ride based on experience, not just how close it was, we wanted to create fun and enjoyable in-car experiences.</p>
<p>For Sidecar Trivia, we created a version of CashCab, where Rider's would answer trivia questions during their ride and win Sidecar credit. To advertise the event, I created an e-mail header as well as an in-car ornament that was meant to make Riders aware they're in a special Sidecar.</p>
