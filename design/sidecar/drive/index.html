  <p>The driver app, in my opinion, is one of the coolest pieces of software that we at Sidecar have produced. In the background, the amount of optimization the team has done to efficiently match people and packages paired with the
  robust mobile apps makes it the mobile product I'm the most proud of working on.</p>
  <p>That being said, it hasn't always been the best product out there. Below, I'll try to give you a glimpse how this ugly duckling became a foundational element to the Sidecar story.</p>

<h1>I. The Problem</h1>
<p>Not pretty, right? Sidecar Drive 1.0, designed on a single piece of looseleaf paper, worked surprisingly well for about two years but was a disaster waiting to happen.
Any new feature would immediately break the design paradigm or lack thereof. Thankfully, my process had grew from nothing to something so I was ready to revisit my old friend: Sidecar Drive.</p>

<p>As our business grew and evolved, we were limited by this app and it's rigid structure of crap. It needed to be rebuilt from the ground up. We needed a Driver app that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unify the experience for solo and shared rides</li>
  <li>Improve the usability of the Driver app</li>
  <li>Build a flexible, yet solid, foundation for future features</li>
</ul>

<p>With the groundwork laid out, it was time to set a timeline, figure out concrete deliverables, and start unpacking this design problem.</p>

<h1>II. The Process</h1>
<p>One of the good parts about 1.0 being out in the open for so long was that we had a good feedback from our Drivers on what was working and what wasn't.</p>
<h2>Things that worked well:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The main flow was simple to progress through (just tap the big, fat orange button to move forward)</li>
  <li>We gave drivers a lot of information on the ride (price, ETA, pickup & dropoff, etc.)</li>
  <li>The overall flow didn't change from ride to ride so muscle memory was easy to build</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things that worked not so well:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Drivers felt rushed for time when accepting a request</li>
  <li>We knew the experience was going to start getting more complex, so we needed to minimize that impact</li>
  <li>There were ways that Drivers could game the system which had larger impacts downstream</li>
</ul>

<p>After interviewing drivers, gathering historical data on usage, and landing on goals and priorities I grabbed a bunch of paper, a few markers, and started
listening to Ratatat's LP4. It was game time.</p>

<h3>The Request</h3>
<p>The request screen is what a Driver uses to accept or decline a ride or delivery trip. With a lot of information (price, ETA, multiple waypoints) and only 12 seconds
to make a decision, Drivers were feeling rushed and said they would love to have more time to accept. While we could've added more time that would impact Riders
and the system as a whole so I tried to see if we could solve the issue in another way.</p>

<p>Hierarchy of information is fundamental to a good experience and to apply that to the request screen, I had to figure out what information was most important to Drivers. After
a few interviews the information fell into this order:
<ol>
  <li>ETA to Pickup</li>
  <li>Price</li>
  <li>Rating</li>
</ol>

<p>This insight was key in laying out the screen and has helped Drivers parse information without feeling rushed. In addition to laying out information in a more
presentable way, I wanted to see if there were other ways we could bend time and help Drivers not feel rushed. I knew designers have used visual tricks to make progress bars
look faster than they are so I figured we could do the opposite and make it appear slower.</p>

<p class="img_caption">Top: Normal. Middle: "Sped up". Bottom: "Slowed down"</p>

<p>While the effect doesn't massively "slow down" the movement, some people were tricked into thinking that the bottom-most timer was a second or two longer than the others. Magic!</p>

<h3>Riders</h3>
<p>With the introduction of Shared Rides, and knowing that Deliveries were only a few months away from productization, we realized we needed a scalable and flexible
way for drivers to view waypoints, contact riders/recipients, and take other actions on the waypoints. A key consideration when designing the whole app was ensuring it was usable
when in a car and potentially from a distance. A term we used to describe these design considerations was 'half-height UI' since an arm-length is half of a persons height (unless you're Michael Phelps and your arms are oddly long).</p> 

<p>Below are some explorations around how Drivers can contact Riders and manage their rides:</p>

<p>In an effort to make tap areas large, this utilized the whole screen as the container for important functions.</p>
<img data-action="zoom"  src="co_pilot_v4.jpg">
<img data-action="zoom"  src="co_pilot_v5.jpg">
<p>This is similar to the exploration above but this was an effort to create something that could be a bit more extensible to more functions and more riders. This was
inspired by Apple's Assistive Touch accessiblity feature on iOS. I really loved this direction but after prototyping it, it was too much of a guessing game as to
what functions will appear where. When a Driver is on the road, muscle memory is key and always having to guess where a button will be is not a good practice.</p>

<p>Moving away from an interface that was very fluid and flexible, I started to explore more concrete implementations.</p>

<!--
<p>Since Driver's spend so much of their time driving and using navigation apps â€“ it felt important to me to study those apps and understand the
underlying principles and interaction paradigms they used. Some of the most common apps our driver used were Waze, Google Maps, and Apple maps. It was
interesting to see how each app had it's own approach to destination entry, turn-by-turn, and trip itineraries. Waze did a good job handling automatic actions (allowing
the driver to keep their hands on the wheel). Apple Maps has a very nice turn-by-turn implementation but is a bit fidgety and doesn't elegantly handle map panning. </p>
