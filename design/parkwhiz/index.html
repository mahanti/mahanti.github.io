<p>To give back to our Driver community, we partnered with ParkWhiz to make it easier for Drivers to find parking around the city. This piece was fun to work on because it was my first time working on a large isometric piece.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things to do, when first showing the concept to colleagues, was to flip a few of the cars and mess with the perspective. Check it out for yourself!</p>
