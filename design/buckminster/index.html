<p>The process of printing has always been one of my favorite parts of being a designer. The physical manifestation of a piece created digitally is awesome.
This piece was made for a printmaking class I took through <a href="http://www.workshopsf.org" target="_blank">workshopSF</a>. It was great learning more about various
printing processes and best practices.</p>
<p>I first read this quote by Buckminster Fuller, the designer/architect/inventor, in college and it has stuck with me throughout the years. Paired with deconstructed geodesic domes, Fuller's famous architectural creation, I aimed to create a piece that had compelling movement and was enjoyable to ook at time and time again.</p>

<p>In all honestly, this is my favorite print that came out of the workshop because of it's imperfections. In my mind it connects well the quote from Buckminster Fuller, "Search others for their virtue, and yourself for your vices."</p>
