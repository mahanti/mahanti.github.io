<p>The process of printing has always been one of my favorite parts of being a designer. Seeing something you've made behind a screen manifest physically is awesome.
This piece was made to use in a printmaking class I took one weekend. It was awesome learning about the screenprinting process and making a few of my own.</p>
<p>I first read this quote by Buckminster Fuller, the designer/architect/inventor, in college and it has stuck with me throughout the years. Paired with deconstructed geodesic domes, Fuller's famous architectural creation, I aimed to create a piece that had compelling movement and was enjoyable to ook at time and time again.</p>

<p>In all honestly, this is my favorite print that came out of the workshop because of it's imperfections. It really connects with the quote from Buckminster Fuller, "Search others for their virtue, and yourself for your vices."</p>
