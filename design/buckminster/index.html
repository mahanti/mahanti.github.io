<p>The process of printing has always been one of my favorite parts of being a designer. Seeing something you've made behind a screen manifest physically is awesome.
This piece was made to use in a printmaking class I took one weekend. It was awesome learning about the screenprinting process and making a few of my own.</p>

<p>In all honestly, this is my favorite print that came out of the workshop because of it's imperfections. It really connects with the quote from Buckminster Fuller, "Search others for their virtue, and yourself for your vices."</p>
