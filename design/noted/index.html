  <p>I take a lot of notes on my phone – whether it's a grocery list, quote, or a quick reminder – notes help me organize my life. Unfortunately, a lot of notetaking apps feel cumbersome to me for my needs. Noted is an iOS app written in Swift designed and built by myself. While it's nowhere near perfect this was a great introduction into building iOS apps and building a tool that helps me get through my day.</p>

<p>Most note taking apps that I've used aren't built for quickly jotting down a note, and most to-do lists don't handle long-form content elegantly. With Noted I aimed to design a product that had enough flexiblity to work for both use cases.</p>
<p>For quickly jotting down notes, you can quickly swipe left or right to make a new note or view old notes respectively. By avoiding tapping and keeping views to fluidly move in and out of each other you can write down your thought and get on with life.</p>
