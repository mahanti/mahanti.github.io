<p>Hey! My name is Arjun and I'm a Product Designer living in <strike>San Francisco</strike> Brooklyn. Originally from mid-Michigan, I studied Art & Design and Computational Informatics at The University of Michigan.</p>
<p>I currently spend my days rethinking restaurant delivery with the talented folks at <a href="http://www.andofood.com">Ando</a>. Previously, I was the first designer at Sidecar which sold to GM in early 2016.</p> 
<p>If you ever want to chat about design, tech, or just want a coffee (or cocktail), <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmahanti">tweet me</a> or send me an <a href="mailto:arjun.mahanti@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
