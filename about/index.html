<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! My name is Arjun Mahanti and I'm a Product Designer living in San Francisco. Originally from mid-Michigan, I studied Art & Design and Computational Informatics at The University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Growing up, I always had an affinity for building. From Lego fortresses to model airplanes, there was something about creating something that was greater than the sum of its parts. Fast forward a decade and I'm doing the same thing at a much larger scale. As the first designer at <a href="https://www.side.cr">Sidecar</a> my role has given me the opportunity to provide design direction and execution across all facets of the organization. From our mobile product suite to our website to our marketing materials it's an honor 
to work on a product that makes a difference in the lives of everyday people.</p>
