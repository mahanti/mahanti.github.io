  <p>Taking notesh as become a daily occurance for me. Unfortunately, most note apps out there are fairly cumbersome to use. I wanted to design an experience that
  made it just as easy to write a quick reminder to planning out your next family vacation. The result is Jot.</p>

<p>Most note-taking apps that I've used aren't built for quickly jotting down a note, and most to-do lists don't handle long-form content elegantly. With Jot I aimed to design a product that had enough flexibility to work for both use cases.</p>
<p>To write a new note using Jot, you simply swipe right-to-left. Want to see all of your old notes? Swipe the other way.</p>
