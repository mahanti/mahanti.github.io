  <p>I take a lot of notes on my phone – whether it's a grocery list, quote, or a quick reminder – notes help me organize my life. Unfortunately, a lot of notetaking apps feel cumbersome to me for my needs. Jot is an iOS app written in Swift designed and built by myself. While it's nowhere near perfect this was a great introduction into building iOS apps and building a tool that helps me get through my day.</p>

<p>Most note-taking apps that I've used aren't built for quickly jotting down a note, and most to-do lists don't handle long-form content elegantly. With Jot I aimed to design a product that had enough flexiblity to work for both use cases.</p>
<p>Using Jot, to write a new note you simply swipe right-to-left. Want to see all of your old notes? Swipe the other way.</p>
