<div class="section_header">
  <p>In summer of 2013 I joined Sidecar the then small team as their first designer to establish and evolve the brand and product across multiple platforms. As is common with most startups, my role has stretched well beyond my title. From writing specs, designing features, and running analytics I have helped grow the company from a concept to a national brand.<p>
  <p>Below you will find case studies of a few of my favorite projects at Sidecar.
  Before diving in, I want to highlight that none of this would be possible without the support, help, and feedback from the rest of the Sidecar team and community.</p>
