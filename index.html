<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! My name is Arjun Mahanti and I'm a Product Designer living in San Francisco. Originally from mid-Michigan, I studied Art & Design and Computational Informatics at The University of Michigan.</p> 
<p>I’ve always loved to build things. Whether its built out of Legos, paper, or code I’m fascinated by building objects that are greater than the sum of their parts. Currently, I’m building and designing <a href="https://side.cr/">Sidecar</a>. As it’s first designer, my role has given me the opportunity to provide design direction and execution across all facets of the organization. From our mobile product suite to our website to our marketing materials it's an honor to work on a product that makes a difference in the lives of everyday people.</p>
