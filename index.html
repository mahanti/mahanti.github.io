<p>Hey! My name is Arjun Mahanti and I'm a Product Designer living in San Francisco. Originally from mid-Michigan, I studied Art & Design and Computational Informatics at The University of Michigan.</p>
<p>I currently spend my days rethinking transportation with the great folks at <a href="https://www.side.cr">Sidecar</a>. As the first designer, my role has given me the opportunity to provide design direction and execution across all facets of the organization. From our mobile product suite to our website to our marketing materials it's an honor 
to work on a product that makes a difference in the lives of everyday people.</p>
<p>If you ever want to chat about design, tech, or just want a coffee (or cocktail), <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmahanti">tweet me</a> or send me an <a href="mailto:arjun.mahanti@gmail.com">email</a>.</p>
