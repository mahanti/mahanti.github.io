<p class="section_header">I had always wanted to design a calendar but was never fond of the flipbook form factor. I ended up making this calendar for my apartment for 2015. The text a the bottom reads, "Gradatim Ferociter", which means "Step by step, ferociously".
That's how I've been trying to live 2015 so it's a nice reminder each and everyday.</p>
