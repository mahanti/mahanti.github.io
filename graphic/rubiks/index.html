<p>Ah the Rubik's Cube. This little puzzle caught my attention when I was in the 7th grade and hasn't lost it since. As an avid speedcuber back in the day (disclaimer: this is NOT an impressive pick-up line), I would spend hours practicing finger tricks and optimizing different algorithm combinations to cut down my time. Eventually, after really solidifying myself as a nerd, I reached my fastest time at 12.24 seconds.</p>
<p>This piece was to remember how much fun I had figuring out and trying to master this puzzle.</p>
