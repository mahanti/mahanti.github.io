<p>In April of 2015, we held a small employee art show at Sidecar. Individuals from across the organization showed off what they make when they're not at the office. From comical charicatures to magnums of great Syrah, it was awesome seeing how truly creative and talented the individuals I work with are.</p>
<p>My contribution to the artshow was a digital print inspired by M.C. Escher and paired with my love for Rubik's Cube. Titled "Escher's Rubik's Cube", I aimed to make a piece that made people take a second, or third, look.</p>

<p>While I believe the single "cube" illustrates the illusion in a focused way the tesselated versions are definitely pretty fun to look at.</p>
