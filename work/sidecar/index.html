					<span class="subtitle">After completing an unsolicited redesign of Sidecar’s first website and sharing it with the founder’s I was asked to come on as the teams founding designer. This meant dropping out of school, moving across the country, and learning how to design on the job. I had never designed an app before but over the five years I was at Sidecar I designed both Rider & Driver apps for iOS and Android along with brand and web design.</span>
