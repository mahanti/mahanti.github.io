            <p class="subtitle">Mining software has historically lagged behind with fragmented tools, complex interfaces, and limited efficiency. Proto Fleet addresses these gaps by unifying key operator needs—power scaling, miner diagnostics, maintenance, and fleet performance—into a single open-source platform that runs on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.</p>
