      <span class="subtitle">I joined Square in 2017 as a Senior Product Designer for Square for Restaurants, Square's vertical POS solution for restaurants. I worked alongside two designers across multiple surfaces, with my primary focus on the Kitchen Display System. I was also deeply involved in the design and development of our point-of-sale and restaurant management solutions.</span>

            <p class="caption">Square Kitchen Display System is a modern, intuitive interface for restaurant staff to manage orders, track inventory, and communicate with the front of house. At the core of the system is a kitchen ticket, or chit, that displays key order details and actions for quick and efficient order fulfillment.</p>

            <p class="caption">To augment the KDS, we designed a sidebar that gave kitchen staff access to additional tools for more efficient order fulfillment. This sidebar, called Launchpad, was a pattern we expanded to the Restaurant Point of Sale product.</p>
