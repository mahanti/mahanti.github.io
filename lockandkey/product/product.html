<p>As a product designer, I aim to build tools and systems that help people interact with technology. Regardless the problem at hand, I strive to produce software that is beautiful, assistive, and sprinked with unexpected delight.</p>
<p>Below are a few select projects that I've worked on over the past few years.</p>
