<p>Sidecar occasionally holds brown bag lunches where employees can give short talks about anything that they're passionate about. For this brown bag, one of our awesome iOS engineers, Lee Fastenau, wanted to talk about his history with making games for the Atari.</p>
<p>On a flight home from Michigan, I made this poster to put up around the office. After hearing his talk I wish I had made a poster that could be drawn on an Atari (limited colors, fixed pixel width, etc.) but all in all I was pretty happy with the outcome.</p>
