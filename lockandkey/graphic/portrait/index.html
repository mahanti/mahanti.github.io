<p>Blind-contour drawings are something that I do to sharpen my hand-eye coordination. It's a great and fun exercise that often results in 
a hilarious rendition of an apple, lamp, or another random object around me. One afternoon I decided to do a blind-contour self-portrait, using my
Thunderbolt Display as a mirror, and it came out surprisingly well. After vectorizing the original sketch, I started to explore different styles.</p>
