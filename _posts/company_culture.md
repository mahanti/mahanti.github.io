Company culture doesn't start and stop at the front door. And it isn't
about happy hours or perks.

Company culture is the blood of your company, product, and vision. It's
how you treat the engineer next to you, or the user submitting a bug
report. 

I believe that a product is very much a reflection of the people
building it and if you don't have the right people, you won't have the
right product.
