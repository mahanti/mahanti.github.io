        <span class="title">About</span>
        <span class="subtitle">I joined Square in 2017 as a Senior Product Designer for Square for Restaurants – Square’s vertical POS solution for Restaurants. I worked alongside two designers across a number of surfaces. My primary focus was the Kitchen Display System but also was deeply involved in the design and development of our point-of-sale and restaurant management solutions.</span>
