        <span class="title">About</span>
        <span class="subtitle">Jot was the first iOS app I ever built — all the way back in 2013. It was designed to solve the problem of having a quick idea or note and not being able to easily toss it into a notepad and move on. In an effort to reduce taps to start new notes, Jot always starts on a fresh page and simple swipe gestures let you archive and view notes.
            <br><br>
            During the pandemic in 2020, I took the time to learn SwiftUI and rebuild the app from the ground up which included folding in another project of mine — Napkin, which was Jot for drawing.</span>
