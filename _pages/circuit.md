        <span class="subtitle">I often run through the same timers in the gym, whether it be for HIIT cycles or just timing planks or stretches. I wanted to build an app with a timer that was easy to see from anywhere and one that could easily be used in-between sets. 
<br><br>
I worked with my friends at Shag City to develop custom sounds which add utility and delight to the app, even when you’re dying from the last set.</span>
